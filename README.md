- 👋 Hi, I’m Edward!
- 💡 I’m interested in...so many different things. You name it! I also love to smile, enjoy life, treat people with kindness, and learn something new everyday.
- 📚 I’m currently learning deployment/infrastructure setups in DevOps, as well as modern tools relating to Full Stack Web Development and blockchain.
  
Cheers.
